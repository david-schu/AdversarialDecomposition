# The Geometry of Adversrial Subspaces

code for the paper "PAPER TITLE"

## Adversarial Subspace Extraction

The extracttion of an adversarial subspace is performed in [SubspaceExtraction/decomp_fun.py](https://github.com/david-schu/TheGeometryOfAdversarialSubspaces/blob/camera_ready/SubspaceExtraction/decomp_fun.py). An n-dimnesional subspace consists of n orthogonal adversarial vectors that are minimized in length, i.e. they have minimal distance to the decision boundary.

Subsequently, the characteristics of extracted adversarial subspaces, esepcially the smoothness of the subspaces in terms of distance to the decision boundary, can be invetsiagted with [dist_to_dec_bnd.py](https://github.com/david-schu/TheGeometryOfAdversarialSubspaces/blob/camera_ready/dist_to_dec_bnd.py).
