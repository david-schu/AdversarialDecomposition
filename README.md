## Data parsing

The data for each subject is parsed from raw data files into pandas DataFrames with load_data.py in the helperFiles folder. Hereby, market predictions generated with the GaussianProcess.py file. To adjust the Gaussian process details, you can change the kernel parameters in the load_data.py file, or the Gaussian Process itself. 

## Jupyter Notebooks

Paper figures are created in two juypter notebooks - [CIFAR analysis](https://github.com/david-schu/AdversarialDecomposition/blob/camera_ready/analysis_notebooks/cifar_analysis.ipynb) and [MNIST analysis](https://github.com/david-schu/AdversarialDecomposition/blob/camera_ready/analysis_notebooks/mnist_analysis.ipynb)
